Accuracy of linking scores was evaluated using Pearson correlation, intraclass correlation coefficients, and mean and SD of score differences. Bland-Altman plots were used to graphically assess the levels of agreement. The consistency in scores' discrimination across levels of pain severity, depression, and other patient characteristics was assessed. Bootstrap methods estimated linking precision across varying sample sizes.RESULTS: Actual and cross-walked PROMIS scores showed moderate correlation (ICC(3,1): GMH 0.73; GPH 0.81), with Bland-Altman plots suggesting smaller differences between scores in patients with lower and higher general health.

The results of preliminary application of the algorithm are described. One of the three neuronal antibodies was positive in 13 patients. In this preliminary investigation, it was suggested that two or more abnormal findings in the diagnostic tests (CSF, MRI, FDG-PET) favors the diagnosis of autoimmune epilepsy. On the other hand, two patients with a positive neuronal antibody test failed the first step (clinical features), partly because epilepsy was not the major manifestation of autoimmune encephalitis (VGKC complex antibody) or due to a relatively low titer of the antibody (GAD antibody).

Pathology specimens were evaluated for tumor adequacy and then analyzed for selected exons of epidermal growth factor receptor, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, and ERBB2. ALK rearrangements were detected with fluorescence in situ hybridization and/or immunohistochemistry. Technical success was recorded and the factors affecting successful profiling were evaluated. Complications (pneumothorax, hemorrhage, and admission) were recorded. Comparison of yield and complications were done between the two groups (core biopsy and fine needle aspiration only group). Utility of PET-CT to guide the needle track for optimized yield was assessed in a subset of patients.RESULTS: Between December 6, 2009, and December 30, 2016, 765 patients with NSCLC underwent TTNB.

There is no standard guideline regarding the timing of surgery, although physicians have prioritized early surgery over the past decades. Although better outcomes have been observed from these studies, the definition of early surgery has been controversial, although mostly limited to 24-hours after injury. For some hospitals, this early surgery could be difficult to implement in practice. Hence, we re-evaluated the timing of early surgery as surgery within 48 hours and investigated the surgical outcomes of SCI depending on whether surgery was performed early (\u226448 hours) or late (>48 hours). The primary outcomes were improvement in the American Spinal Injury Association Impairment Scale (AIS) grade in early and late surgery groups.METHODS: This study was a retrospective cohort study in individuals aged 15-85 years, who underwent surgery for SCI between 2005 and 2016. The rate of AIS grade improvements was measured at 6 months after injury.

Mindfulness meditation is gaining attention for its potential to facilitate health-promoting behavior and may address some limitations of existing interventions for physical activity. However, little evidence exists on mindfulness meditation and physical activity. This study assessed whether mindfulness meditation is uniquely associated with physical activity in a nationally representative sample.METHOD: Cross-sectional data from the adult sample (N = 34,525) of the 2012 National Health Interview Survey were analyzed. Logistic regression models tested whether past-year use of mindfulness meditation was associated with (a) inactivity and (b) meeting aerobic physical activity recommendations, after accounting for sociodemographics, another health-promoting behavior, and 2 other types of meditation. Data were weighted to represent the U.S. civilian, noninstitutionalized adult population.RESULTS: Accounting for covariates, U.S. adults who practiced mindfulness meditation in the past year were less likely to be inactive and more likely to meet physical activity recommendations. Mindfulness meditation showed stronger associations with these indices of physical activity than the 2 other types of meditation.CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that mindfulness meditation specifically, beyond meditation in general, is associated with physical activity in U.S adults. Future research should test whether intervening with mindfulness meditation-either as an adjunctive component or on its own-helps to increase or maintain physical activity.

The association between satisfaction with the neighborhood environment and QOL, and health-related behaviors which mediated the effect were investigated.METHODS: A sample of 317 residents completed a questionnaire which comprised the WHOQOL-BREF (Hong Kong version) to assess QOL, the International Physical Activity Questionnaire (IPAQ) to study physical activities, and questions on satisfaction with the neighborhood environment, health-related behaviors and socio-demographics. One-way ANOVA and linear regression were used to study the associations between environmental satisfaction and QOL in the four domains, overall QOL and general health, followed by assessing the relationships between environmental satisfaction and the potential health-related behavior mediators with regression tests.

However, although many studies reported an advantage in the recognition of dynamic over static expressions in clinical populations, results obtained from healthy participants are contrasted. To clarify this issue, we conducted a large cross-sectional study to investigate FER across the life span in order to determine if age is a critical factor to account for such discrepancies. More than 400 observers (age range 5-96) performed recognition tasks of the six basic expressions in static, dynamic, and shuffled (temporally randomized frames) conditions, normalized for the amount of energy sampled over time. We applied a Bayesian hierarchical step-linear model to capture the nonlinear relationship between age and FER for the different viewing conditions. Although replicating the typical accuracy profiles of FER, we determined the age at which peak efficiency was reached for each expression and found greater accuracy for most dynamic expressions across the life span. This advantage in the elderly population was driven by a significant decrease in performance for static images, which was twice as large as for the young adults.

Most federal health agencies adopted the same policy, but the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) did not. A 2012 law encouraged the FDA to ensure that new medical products be analyzed for safety and effectiveness for key demographic patient groups. Our study of high-risk medical devices reviewed by the FDA in 2014-2017 found that due to lack of patient diversity and publicly available data, clinicians and patients often cannot determine which devices are safe and effective for specific demographic groups.CONTEXT: Demographic differences can influence the safety and effectiveness of medical devices; however, clinical trials of devices for adults have historically underrepresented women, people of color, and patients over age 65. The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) Safety and Innovation Act became law in 2012, encouraging greater diversity and subgroup analyses. In 2013, the FDA reported that there was diversity in clinical trials considered \"pivotal\" for approval decisions and that subgroup analyses were conducted for most applications for the highest-risk medical devices. However, the FDA's report did not specify whether analyses included sufficient numbers to be meaningful, whether analyses were conducted for most major subgroups, or whether analyses included safety, effectiveness, or accuracy.METHODS: We examined publicly available documents for all 22\u00a0medical devices that the FDA designated \"highest risk\" or \"novel,\"\u00a0were reviewed through the premarket approval pathway, and were scrutinized\u00a0at FDA public meetings from 2014 to 2017. We evaluated patient demographics and subgroup analyses for all pivotal trials.FINDINGS: Only 3 (14%) of the devices provided subgroup analyses for both effectiveness and safety or both sensitivity and selectivity for gender, race, and age. However, 55% of the devices reported both of those subgroup analyses for at least 1 of the 3 subgroups. Whether analyses were reported or not, the number of patients in most subgroups was too small to draw meaningful conclusions. Subgroup analyses were more likely to be reported to the FDA's Advisory Committees than in the FDA's public reviews or labeling.CONCLUSIONS: Despite a law encouraging more diversity and subgroup analyses in pivotal trials used as the basis for FDA approval, the results of our study indicate relatively few subgroup analyses are publicly available for the highest-risk and novel medical devices.

A vast burden of worlds visually impaired live in low-income settings especially in sub Saharan Africa. In such settings the blindness is associated with considerable disability and excess mortality, resulting in huge economic and social consequence. The main purpose of this study was to determine the prevalence and associated factors of low vision and blindness among patients at St. Paul's hospital millenium medical college.METHODS: Institution based cross sectional design study was carried out from January to April, 2017 with sample size of 904. Systematic random sampling was used to recruit the study subjects. Retrospective medical chart review was done; data was entered into and analyzed by SPSS 23.

Decisions regarding treatment and further examinations are made based on the initial evaluation. We aimed to evaluate the reliability of the early syndromic diagnosis in NOS and find predictive factors to establish a consistent early diagnosis based on the semiology and prompt supplementary examinations.METHODS: We recruited patients attended in our ED for NOS over 2 years (2014-2015), excluding patients with a loss of consciousness of suspected non-epileptic origin. All patients were assessed by a neurologist. A baseline diagnosis was established according to clinical findings and neuroimaging/EEG data.

Histology confirmed two malignant T-cell and 18 malignant B cell non-Hodgkin lymphomas as well as one patient suffering from systemic lymphoma with chronic polypoid sinusitis. SUVmax levels of orbital findings were significantly lower after therapy (p\u00a0<\u00a00.001; Fisher's exact test).

The underlying causes are not fully understood, and prospective studies are lacking. Therefore, we conducted a prospective, observational cohort study investigating sleep quality, fatigue, quality of life, and comorbidities in patients with MS.METHODS: Patients with relapsing-remitting MS or clinically isolated syndrome treated with interferon beta-1b were followed over two years. The primary objective was to investigate correlations between sleep quality (PSQI), fatigue (MFIS), and functional health status (SF-36). Secondary objectives were to investigate correlations of sleep quality and daytime sleepiness (ESS), depression (HADS-D), anxiety (HADS-A), pain (HSAL), and restless legs syndrome (RLS). We applied descriptive statistics, correlation and regression analyses.RESULTS: 139 patients were enrolled, 128 were available for full analysis. The proportion of poor sleepers (PSQI\u22655) was 55.47% at the beginning and 37.70% by the end of the study (106 and 41 evaluable questionnaires, respectively). Poor sleepers performed worse in MFIS, SF-36, ESS, HADS-D, and HADS-A scores. The prevalence of patients with RLS was low (4.5%) and all were poor sleepers. Poor sleep quality was positively correlated with fatigue and low functional health status. These relationships were corroborated by multivariable-adjusted regression analyses. ESS values and poor sleep quality at baseline seem to predict sleep quality at the one-year follow-up.

We performed a population-based study to evaluate the overall prevalence and impact of LUTS including overactive bladder (OAB) in adults aged \u226540 years in China.Adults aged \u226540 years were eligible to participate in this internet-based survey, provided that they had the ability to access the internet, to use a computer and to read the local language. The survey contained questions relating to International Continence Society (ICS) symptom definitions, the International Prostate Symptom Score (IPSS) and the Overactive Bladder Symptom Score (OABSS). The primary study objective was to determine the prevalence of LUTS using the ICS 2002 symptom definition.Among the 4136 respondents, 2080 (50.3%) were men and 1347 (32.6%) were aged \u226560 years. LUTS prevalence according to ICS criteria was 60.3% in men and 57.7% in women. All 3 ICS symptom groups (voiding, storage, and postmicturition) were present in 22.8% of women and 24.2% of men, making this the most common combination of ICS symptom groups. The most bothersome symptoms were terminal dribble and nocturia. According to IPSS scores, 32.9% of participants had at least moderate symptoms. The prevalence of OAB was 23.9%. The presence of LUTS-particularly all 3 ICS symptom groups-was associated with reduced sexual QOL in women, reduced satisfaction with erectile function in men, higher anxiety and depression scores, and reduced health-related QOL (physical health and mental health domains). The overall percentage of participants with LUTS visiting healthcare professionals for urinary symptoms was 38%.In conclusion, LUTS affect the majority of adults aged \u226540 years in China, and prevalence increases with increasing age. LUTS are associated with impaired QOL and mental health, but fewer than half of individuals in China with LUTS seek healthcare for their symptoms.

However, zoopotentiation has also been observed. Thus, the presence of livestock has been widely accepted as an important variable for the prevalence and risk of malaria, but the effectiveness of zooprophylaxis remained subject to debate. This study aims to critically analyse the effects of the presence of livestock on malaria prevalence using a large dataset from Indonesia.METHODS: This study is based on data from the Indonesia Basic Health Research (\"Riskesdas\") cross-sectional survey of 2007 organized by the National Institute of Health Research and Development of Indonesia's Ministry of Health. The subset of data used in the present study included 259,885 research participants who reside in the rural areas of 176 regencies throughout the 15 provinces of Indonesia where the prevalence of malaria is higher than the national average. The variable \"existence of livestock\" and other independent demographic, social and behavioural variables were tested as potential determinants for malaria prevalence by multivariate logistic regressions.RESULTS: Raising medium-sized animals in the house was a significant predictor of malaria prevalence (OR\u2009=\u20092.980; 95% CI 2.348-3.782, P\u2009<\u20090.001) when compared to keeping such animals outside of the house (OR\u2009=\u20091.713; 95% CI 1.515-1.937, P\u2009<\u20090.001). After adjusting for gender, age, access to community health facility, sewage canal condition, use of mosquito nets and insecticide-treated bed nets, the participants who raised medium-sized animals inside their homes were 2.8 times more likely to contract malaria than respondents who did not (adjusted odds ratio\u2009=\u20092.809; 95% CI 2.207-3.575; P\u2009<\u20090.001).CONCLUSIONS: The results of this study highlight the importance of livestock for malaria transmission, suggesting that keeping livestock in the house contributes to malaria risk rather than prophylaxis in Indonesia.

Screening cancer was defined by performing at least one of the following tests: PSA, fecal occult blood test, mammography, abdominopelvic iconography (abdominal ultrasound and/or abdominal CT scan). We recorded the suspected cancer tests, the cancers diagnosed, their stage and the survival. These results were expressed as a percentage with a 95% confidence interval.RESULTS: Out of the 491 patients treated for a VTE, screening cancer was performed on 295 patients (median age 66.2 years).

The treatment regimens were categorized into 3 groups according to the type of PD solution used: original PD (1.5% glucose), shuffle PD (1.5 and 2.5% glucose), and serialized PD (2.5 and 4.5% glucose). Multivariate analysis (using the Weibull model) was applied to comprehensively examine survival probabilities related to the explanatory variable, while adjusting for other potential confounders.RESULTS: Of 300 consecutive patients, 38% died over a median follow-up time of 30 months (interquartile range: 15-46 months). Multivariate analysis showed that a treatment regimen with continued higher-strength PD solution (serialized PD) resulted in a lower survival rate than when the conventional strength solution was used (adjusted hazard ratio, 2.6; 95% confidence interval, 1.6 to 4.6, p<0.01). Five interrelated risk factors (age, length of time on PD, hemoglobin levels, albumin levels, and oliguria) were significant predictors contributing to the outcome.CONCLUSIONS: Frequent exposure to high levels of glucose PD solution significantly contributed to a 2-fold higher rate of death, especially when hypertonic glucose was prescribed continuously.", "mesh_labels": ["Adult", "Age Factors", "Aged", "Aged, 80 and over", "Diabetes Complications", "Female", "Glucose Solution, Hypertonic", "Hemoglobins", "Humans", "Kidney Diseases", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Multivariate Analysis", "Peritoneal Dialysis", "Proportional Hazards Models", "Retrospective Studies", "Risk Factors", "Sex Factors", "Survival Rate", "Young Adult"]}, {"article": "Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) is among the most frequent malignancies of the salivary gland, and is notorious for its prolonged clinical course characterized by frequent recurrences often years after initial treatment.

This was not confirmed in the validation cohort, in which qPCR identified high expression of hsa-mir-21, hsa-mir-181a-2, and hsa-mir-152 to be associated with reduced OS and high expression of hsa-miR-374c to be associated with improved RFS. Interestingly, two distinct subsets of ACC separated in microRNA expression irrespective of gene fusion status, but without significant difference in outcome.

The aims of this paper were i) to use theoretical models of HRQoL to develop a conceptual framework for causal and effect relationships among the five dimensions of the EQ-5D instrument, and ii) to empirically test this framework.METHODS: A conceptual framework depicts the symptom dimensions [Pain/discomfort (PD) and Anxiety/depression (AD)] as causal indicators that drive a change in the effect indicators of activity/participation [Mobility (MO), Self-care (SC) and Usual activities (UA)], where MO has an intermediate position between PD and the other two effect dimensions (SC and UA). Confirmatory tetrad analysis (CTA) and confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) were used to test this framework using EQ-5D-5L data from 7933 respondents in six countries, classified as healthy (n\u2009=\u20091760) or in one of seven disease groups (n\u2009=\u20096173).RESULTS: CTA revealed the best fit for a model specifying SC and UA as effect indicators and PD, AD and MO as causal indicators.

The epidemiology of CKD, a concern among patients with DM, has not been studied in Botswana. Consequently, the objective of this study was to estimate its prevalence among these patients in Botswana to provide future guidance to both government personnel and physicians.METHODS: Observational cross-sectional study in a leading clinic in Botswana. Demographic and clinical data were obtained from patients through interviews and from their notes using a standard questionnaire. The study was conducted from July to October 2015. The estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) was calculated using the Modification of Diet for Renal Disease equation. CKD was defined as an eGFR <\u00a060\u00a0ml/min/1.73\u00a0m2. Multivariable logistic regression analyses were performed to assess the associations between CKD and potential factors.RESULTS: The mean age and duration of DM among study participants were 54.67\u00a0years (range 21-92\u00a0years) and 5.0\u00a0years, respectively. Over half, i.e. 213/370 (57.6%) and 232/370 (62.7%), had an average blood pressure greater than 140/90\u00a0mmHg and poor glycemic control (HbA1c >\u00a07%), respectively. 31/370 patients (8.4%) had CKD. However, only 18/370 (4.9%) had a diagnosis of CKD documented in their charts.

However, half of patients with CKD are not documented resulting in the potential for prescription errors and drug toxicity. A substantial number of our patients had uncontrolled hypertension and poor glycemic control. Older age, low level of education and longer duration of DM were associated with CKD.

In predictive analytics models utilizing hierarchical multiple regression analyses controlling for relevant demographic and clinical covariates, diabetes symptoms accounted for 38 and 39% of the variance in patient-reported generic HRQOL for type 1 and type 2 diabetes, respectively, reflecting large effect sizes. The diabetes symptoms facets hyperglycemia symptoms, hypoglycemia symptoms, and nonspecific diabetes symptoms individually accounted for a significant percentage of the variance in separate exploratory predictive analytics models after controlling for demographic and clinical covariates, with small-to-large effect sizes.CONCLUSIONS: Diabetes symptoms are potentially modifiable predictors of generic HRQOL in AYA with diabetes. Identifying specific diabetes symptoms or symptoms facets that are the most important predictors from the patient perspective facilitates a patient-centered approach in clinical research, clinical trials, and practice designed to enhance overall generic HRQOL in AYA with diabetes.", "mesh_labels": ["Adolescent", "Adult", "Diabetes Mellitus, Type 2", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Quality of Life", "Surveys and Questionnaires", "Young Adult"]}, {"article": "AIMS: We hypothesized that patients with dysregulated type 2 diabetes may be stratified based on routine clinical markers.METHODS: In this retrospective cohort study, diabetes related clinical measures including age at onset, diabetes duration, HbA1c, BMI, HOMA2-\u03b2, HOMA2-IR and GAD65 autoantibodies, were used for sub-grouping patients by K-means clustering and for adjusting. Probability of diabetes complications (95% confidence interval), were calculated using logistic regression.RESULTS: Based on baseline data from patients with type 2 diabetes (n\u202f=\u202f2290), the cluster analysis suggested up to five sub-groups. These were primarily characterized by autoimmune \u03b2-cell failure (3%), insulin resistance with short disease duration (21%), non-autoimmune \u03b2-cell failure (22%), insulin resistance with long disease duration (32%), and presence of metabolic syndrome (22%), respectively. Retinopathy was more common in the sub-group characterized by non-autoimmune \u03b2-cell failure (52% (47.7-56.8)) compared to other sub-groups (22% (20.1-24.1)), adj. p\u202f<\u202f0.001. The prevalence of cardiovascular disease, nephropathy and neuropathy also differed between sub-groups, but significance was lost after adjustment.CONCLUSIONS: Patients with type 2 diabetes cluster into clinically relevant sub-groups based on routine clinical markers. The prevalence of diabetes complications seems to be sub-group specific.

These subjects were divided into a normal group A, an experimental group B and a control group C. Venous blood was drawn and tested for four serum tumor markers. The SPSS 18.0 analytic system was then used to analyze the data. Tumor markers for GC at different stages, different pathological patterns and tumor incidence are discussed. The difference in expression levels of tumor markers between group C and group A was not statistically significant (P>0.05). The differences in expression levels between group B in stage I and stage II and those of groups A and C was statistically significant (P less than 0.05). At the same time, the differences in expression levels of group B in stage III and stage IV and those of groups A and C were also statistically significant (P less than 0.01). For different sizes of tumors, taking 5 cm as a maximum, normal expression and abnormal expression of the four tumor markers was different (P less than 0.05). The tumor incidence of the combined test for the four tumor markers was conspicuously higher than that of single tests. Moreover, the difference between the tumor incidence of the combined test in stages I, II and III and that of single tests in the same stages was of statistical significance (P less than 0.05); however, the difference was not statistically significant in stage IV (P>0.05). The combined testing for tumor markers is useful for clinical diagnosis of GC.", "mesh_labels": ["Adult", "Aged", "Biomarkers, Tumor", "Female", "Humans", "Male", "Middle Aged", "Stomach Neoplasms"]}, {"article": "Aim: The aim of the study was to determine the most commonly diagnosed neoplasms in the MRI scanned patient population and indicate correlations based on the descriptive variables.Methods: The SPSS software was used to determine the incidence of neoplasms within the specific diagnoses based on the descriptive variables of the studied population. Over a five year period, 791 patients and 839 MRI scans were identified in neoplasm category (C00-D48 according to the International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems ICD-10).Results: More women (56%) than men (44%) represented C00-D48. Three categories of neoplasms were recorded. Furthermore, benign neoplasms were the most numerous, diagnosed mainly in patients in the fifth decade of life, and included benign neoplasms of the brain and other parts of the central nervous system.Conclusions: Males \u2264 30 years of age with neoplasms had three times higher MRI scans rate than females of the same age group; even though females had much higher scans rate in every other category. The young males are more often selected for these scans if a neoplasm is suspected.
